    "review": "The Build quality is very poor, Never purchase this product. It broke in a month even tho I was using my new headphone very carefully. It broke because the plastic used at that point is very weak and cheap."

    "review": "I am experiencing broken sound if the distance is beyond 6ft in clear sight arrangement and with 100% battery. Other BT works absolutely fine much beyond this hence I feel this is something to be concerned of as the supported distance seems to less. I used with my Sony 65 Smart TV. With Laptop it seems to work well"
